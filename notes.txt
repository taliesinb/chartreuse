so this is purely L->R parser so far.

So when we put down a trigger we can instantiate fragments at the trigger position. of course terminal fragments can just look ahead to see
if their tokens are there already, and quit if not. so this will be depth first if we immediately ask symbols to grow.

how will this growing work?

so we have a blank match. it adds a trigger at its position for its first token.
